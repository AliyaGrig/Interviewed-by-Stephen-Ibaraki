# Interviewed-by-Stephen-Ibaraki
Recently, I had the advantage of being interviewed by Stephen Ibaraki (https://lnkd.in/d3KJDJkx) where we discussed my journey as an innovator, entrepreneur, and founder of Evolwe AI and The Cosmos City. We explored the exciting field of artificial consciousness and its applications in creating empathetic #AI #technology and personalized experiences.

During the interview, we delved into the core principles behind Evolwe AI and how we specialize in developing cutting-edge AI using #neuromorphic architecture. Our focus is on building #empatheticAI that enables human-like interactions and personalized experiences. By combining advanced technologies such as #theoryofmind, metacognition, psychometrics, and #NLP, we have created a state-of-the-art AI architecture that provides #empathy, reasoning, and cognitive skills similar to those of a human.

Evolwe AI offers three core products to businesses and end-users. These include #generativeagents for businesses, AI tools for complex problem-solving in healthcare and climate change, and SensEI, a new generation of AI assistant for end-users. Our platform incorporates cutting-edge #AGI architecture that integrates principles from consciousness studies, neuroscience, and #cognitivescience.

Throughout the interview, we explored my background in launching tech #startups at a global scale, collaborations with prestigious organizations such as Boeing, NASA, and Lexus, and my research on human consciousness, meditation, neuro interfaces, and AGI. I shared insights from my diverse professional career, including successful exits from space tech startups and collaborations with Fortune 500 companies.

I am grateful for the opportunity to share my expertise and insights with Stephen Ibaraki and the audience. It was a stimulating #conversation, and I look forward to continuing to drive innovation in the field of #artificialconsciousness and make a positive impact on our world.
